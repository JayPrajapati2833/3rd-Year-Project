# My 3rd-year eNews project is a dynamic platform built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and XAMPP. Featuring a secure admin login for adding news, it offers a variety of categories like Latest News, National, Sports, and Technology. The feedback page allows users to submit feedback with name and email, and a search function ensures easy navigation. A sleek sidebar showcases categories alongside social media links to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, while copyright and 'All rights reserved' are displayed at the bottom. This project blends user-friendly design with practical features, making it a standout web application
